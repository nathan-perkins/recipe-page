### What I learned

While working on this project, I refined my understanding of sementic HTML, and I learned more about styling lists and tables with CSS.

### Continued development

In the future I want to explore other ways to organize my CSS. I used BEM in this project, but I suspect that OOCSS or other methods could have helped me stay more organized for this particular project.

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell's YouTube vidoes on various topics were very useful to me as I worked on this project. His videos on styling lists and tables were particularly helpful.
